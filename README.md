This program will parse a ham radio log file in the ADI format to show logged but unconfirmed contacts in a particular band. The list maybe printed or saved to a file. It requires python3.

This helps in following up with amateur operators to see if your contact is in their log and request confirmation.

The program is known to run in 24.04 Ubuntu.
